# ABQ Film Tour

### Aims
Albuquerque, New Mexico is becoming a destination for film tourism. It has been featured as a shooting location in many popular movies and television series, iconically for series such as Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. We believe that there is more potential for tourism and commercial opportunities for the community. Already businesses are capitalizing on tourists attracted by their favorite movies and shows. We hope our app can be utilized to help promote Albuquerque and allow residents and tourists alike to facilitate their own mobile tours of filming locations in the city. Our initial database of locations utilizes city provided open data, but we have also allowed for user submitted content so that enthusiasts can build upon the initial dataset. As businesses such as Netflix expand into the area we believe that our app will create an amazing way to experience the city.

### Web service
[DDL](https://abqfilmtour.github.io/ABQFilmTourBackend/create.sql) <br />
The backend REST API for this application is hosted at jscpeterson.com. Endpoints are: <br />
jscpeterson.com/rest/users/ <br />
jscpeterson.com/rest/production/ <br />
jscpeterson.com/rest/film_locations/ <br />
jscpeterson.com/rest/film_locations/{location_id}/user_comments/ <br />
jscpeterson.com/rest/film_locations/{location_id}/images/ <br />
Endpoints are restricted to Android application users through Oauth2 authentication. Users with elevated privileges can view and modify the database with assistance from the OdeonClient project.

### State of completion
The application currently loads and can populate a map of Albuquerque with film locations stored in a backend database with certain filters provided by the user. The user can view all locations in the database, view all locations in their general vicinity, view locations associated with a film or television series, or view locations that have been flagged as bookmarked by the user. Opening a location map marker provides the user with more information about the production and shoot. The user can submit their location to an existing production in the database, or submit a comment to an existing location. When this project is officially released, these will not be displayed until approved by a member of the team. To fully demonstrate the capabilites of the application at this stage in development all submissions are approved immediately, however, a member of the team will be monitoring traffic and has the capability to ban malicious users from the service. 

### Stretch goals
- Complete image submission and retrieval for individual locations and. This feature is about 60% to completion.
- Creating a more elaborate user comment system with features including: better user comment boxes with timestamps and display images, a reply to comment feature, and an upvote/downvote voting system to encourage helpful commenting.
- Caching data on the local device so the app is still usable offline, using a persistence library such as ROOM.
- Improving the OdeonClient project to allow anyone who wants to assist with the team limited access to database features for moderation purposes. 
- Further backend security measures, such as request and submission throttling.
- Integrate Google Maps directions for bookmarked locations so that a user can have directions from one location to the next in a self-made tour.
- Translate our usage instructions into Spanish so that the help (ayuda) option on the menu is supported in Spanish.
