## Usage Instructions

On first run, the app will ask for Google Sign-In authentication as well as permission to use the device’s location. Some features of ABQFilmTour will require this permission to run properly.

On first run, the app will toast the user to select a title to get started. If the user has already used the app, the map will automatically populate map pins of the last title the user selected. The user can select their favorite movie or TV show titles from the dropdown menu to further narrow down the sites that they are interested in. Once a title is selected, corresponding location pins will be populated on the map.

When a user clicks on a pin, a brief description snippet will pop up with the production title and site name. When a snippet is selected more information can be viewed including pictures and user comments. 

A near me function is also available from the dropdown menu. If the user is within Albuquerque city limits, the map will zoom into the user’s location and populate map pins for all nearby filming locations.

A submit button is also available from the dropdown menu. A submit pop up screen allows the user to add a photo from their device along with a location name and comment.
