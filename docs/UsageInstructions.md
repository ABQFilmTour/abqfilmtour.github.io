# Usage Instructions

On first run, the app will ask for Google Sign-In authentication as well as permission to use the device’s location. Some features of ABQFilmTour will require this permission to run properly.

## Maps screen
On first run, the app will load data from the database and the progress will be shown with a simple spinner animation in the center of the screen. Once data has been loaded, the app will prompt the user to select a title to get started. If the user has already used the app, the map will automatically populate map pins of the last title the user selected. The user can select movie or TV show titles from the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen to further narrow down the sites that they are interested in. Once a title is selected, corresponding location pins will be populated on the map. The user can manipulate the map as they would a typical Google Maps service. *link to Google Maps tutorial?*

## Drop Down Menu
The drop down menu is located on the top right hand side of the title toolbar. 

### All Locations Menu Option
Selecting the "All Locations" option will populate the map with every location in the database. There are nearly 1,000 locations on the map so this is only recommended if the map is already zoomed into an area that the user is interested in.

### Near Me Menu Option
A near me function is also available from the dropdown menu. If the user is within Albuquerque city limits, the map will zoom into the user’s location and populate map pins for all filming locations within approximately a mile radius. Note the device's location must be turned on for this function to be useable.

### Film

### Television

### Bookmarks

### Submit
If the user wants to submit their current location as a film location, they can use the "Submit" option after selecting an existing film or television series from the drop down menu. The app will assume the user wants to submit to the last film or television series selected, if the user has not yet selected a film or television series, they will be prompted to do so. Once the submission has been approved by an administrator, it will display in the dataset.

*Note* - As this phase of development all locations are immediately approved, but traffic is still monitored.

If a production filmed in Albuquerque does not exist in our dataset, please [contact us](abqfilmtour@gmail.com).

### Sign Out

## Location screen
When a user clicks on a pin, a brief description snippet will pop up with the production title and site name. When the snippet is selected the user will be taken to the location screen.

### Post Comment


### Post Image
This feature is currently unimplemented. We plan to implement user submitted images of filming locations in a later release.
