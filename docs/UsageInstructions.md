# Usage Instructions

On first run, the app will ask for Google Sign-In authentication as well as permission to use the device’s location. Some features of ABQFilmTour will require this permission to run properly.

## Maps screen
On first run, the app will load data from the database and the progress will be shown with a simple spinner animation in the center of the screen. Once data has been loaded, the app will prompt the user to select a title to get started. If the user has already used the app, the map will automatically populate map pins of the last title the user selected. The user can select their favorite movie or TV show titles from the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the screen to further narrow down the sites that they are interested in. Once a title is selected, corresponding location pins will be populated on the map. The user can manipulate the map as they would a typical Google Maps service. *link to Google Maps tutorial?*

### All Locations
Selecting the "All Locations" option will populate the map with every location in the database. There are nearly 1,000 locations on the map so this is only recommended if you have already zoomed into an area of the map you are interested in nearby locations for. 

### Near Me
A near me function is also available from the dropdown menu. If the user is within Albuquerque city limits, the map will zoom into the user’s location and populate map pins only for filming locations within approximately a mile radius.

### Submit
If the user wants to submit their current location as a film location, they can use the "Submit" option after selecting an existing film or television series from the drop down menu. The app will assume the user wants to submit to the last film or television series selected, if the user has not yet selected a film or television series, they will be prompted to. Once it has been approved, it will display in the dataset.

*Note* - As this phase of development of development all locations are immediately approved, but traffic is still monitored.

If a production filmed in Albuquerque does not exist in our dataset, please [contact us](email address here).

### Bookmarks

## Location screen
When a user clicks on a pin, a brief description snippet will pop up with the production title and site name. When the snippet is selected the user will be taken to the location screen.
